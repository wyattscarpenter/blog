Hi, welcome to my programming-themed weblog. To see my real programming projects, check out <https://wyattscarpenter.github.io> or <https://github.com/wyattscarpenter>.

## The care and feeding of this blog

<https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/blog> is the git repo where this blog is hosted.

This blog updates whenever I have something to say. You may subscribe to this blog using RSS at <https://wyattscarpenter.github.io/blog/rss.xml><!--Here's the rss as an html alternate link, although I don't know if anything honors this in any particular way.--><link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Wyatt S Carpenter’s Blog, RSS Feed" href="rss.xml"/>. You can also Watch the repo on github at <https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/blog> to receive emails and/or github notifications about updates. I reserve the right to post- or pre- date posts a little (but only a little), for aesthetic purposes, so don't be alarmed if a post shows up in your feed a couple days off. (Similarly, the RSS standard demands to know exactly when the post was published, down to the second, which I've never tracked; so, (if I convert to RSS standard time format) I just use the zero value for those extra-precise time components.) It's also occurred to me that this guarantee is fairly useless to you, the ultimate reader, because I take full advantage of the decentralized nature of git while writing my posts, and have various posts on various machines, and only actually push to the github where you can see them when I can — so, in a sense, all bets are off.

You can search the full text of my blog using <https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/blog/search?q=example>. You can also use the rss link above to get the full text of this blog, and then (for example) ctrl-f it.

If you have any comments or corrections, feel free to submit a pull request <https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/blog/pulls>. Note: by doing this, you agree to release your contribution into the public domain under CC0.

If you don't know the C programming language, you may enjoy reading <https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/guide-to-c> to gain background for many of these posts.

Weblog entries that are about philosophy instead of programming (or in addition to programming) are marked with 𝝋, unicode bold italic lowercase phi. Political philosophy is marked with 𝝅𝝋, pi-phi of the aforementioned style.
