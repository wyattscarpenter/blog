My good buddy Jason tells me that the philosopher Heidegger uses the term thrownness, probably in German or whatever, to describe the condition that we find ourselves in life. our lives sort of start in media res, with us being born into all sorts of relationships and civilizational practices and so forth, and we just have to continue on from there.
