people are very fat now

4 hypotheses

natural (good food)

natural (tastier food)

natural (less satiating food)

you're being posoned.

all have some plausibility. 4 will be a real mindtrip if we find out. however, the puzzle is that we shouldn't need shoddy studies to barely find and effect on something that's poisoning us this bad to create the obesity epidemic. It should basically be incredibly obvious, and therefore easily to stop. But we don't really see that. which is weird.
