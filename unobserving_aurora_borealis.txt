"Uh—! Aurora borealis? At this time of year, at this time of day,  in this part of the country, localized entirely within your kitchen?!"
"Yes!"
"May I see it?"
"No."
—“Steamed Hams” (as it is known)

Due to solar activity, I am led to believe, the aurora borealis (or "the northern lights") has been visible this past weekend not only in Alaska, but across much of the continental United States. But it's been overcast where I am, so I haven't been able to see it. So, whatever, I guess God isn't real. Nevermind.
