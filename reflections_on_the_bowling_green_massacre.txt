Unbidden, "bowling green massacre" leapt into my mind. 
Donald Trump — who, by the way, isn't the source of the bowling green massacre thing — talks about a lot of things inaccurately, which is the source of the idea that you should take him seriously but not literally. 
And the reason for this is that he's not very smart.
It's pretty clear to me that many people could do what Trump has done. Like, the bar for performance is not that high.
(As with most claims of this type, you shouldn't understand this to mean that, like, any guy you meet at a bar could do what Trump is doing, but rather that people of Trump's intelligence and skill, or greater, are not that rare. I feel like I speak to several every day, and meet new ones at a significant frequency.)
(Hell, administrations being what they are, many people *are* doing his things instead of Trump.)
(It seems to me that being a politician selects for the trait of wanting to be a politician (a job which, all told, seems very annoying unless you highly value the perks) more than it does for intelligence or any other skill.)
Which I suppose is the real force between the "small loan of a million dollars" meme/soundbite. Sure, Trump earned his billion dollars. No doubt about it. But you, O listener of above-average intelligence, could have earned a billion dollars too, if you started with a million dollars, from your dad, which was but a small loan to you.
How many liquid million dollars have you ever had in your life, to do with as you wish? Probably not many!
As I've said:
My talents are being wasted. I should become a billionaire.
