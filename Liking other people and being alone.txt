reflection on my strange sleep schedule and living situation making me very alone even though I actually don't want to be and I enjoy the company of others and am otherwise fairly normal.

The conclusion of this reflection is, of course, my normal conclusion that I should do fewer projects so that I can capitalize on the time that I do actually get with people.

coda: 2020. there were a lot of lame introvert jokes - - everyone knew they were lame they were made in that spirit, I don't but grudge them dash dash about how haha normal people have to live like I do now lol. and actually, having lived that way for very long and not being an introvert actually, I think it's very apparent why the COVID-19 lockdowns were basically inhumane to a lot of people. so like putting everyone in solitary confinement almost. I don't think it would pass the Geneva convention. so even though my life didn't change that much, although I did unrelatedly have a bad time, I certainly understand why everyone else is a life changed for the worse. Also I was trying to change my life for the better at that time and I didn't get to ; F.
