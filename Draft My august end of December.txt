Christmas Eve good, days after Christmas Eve not so good, but then I recovered.

I always like to get a head start on my new years resolutions. i begin work on them in December, so that when January breaks they're already in full swing. also, i don't usually care about new years resolutions. I just always do the thing that seems like the best thing to do.
