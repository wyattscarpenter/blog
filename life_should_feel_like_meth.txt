This is exactly what life is supposed to be like.

Every time I do drugs (first of all it's pretty fantastic (if you do it right), but, secondly:) I'm shamed by them to realize actually that's what life is supposed to be like, usually, and I'm often failing to achieve it for myself.

I don't do drugs that often btw.

The same also applies to going to musical concerts. And many types of taking a walk outside. I do them and then I'm like "why am I not doing these more often?" (or sometimes: "all the time").

> When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.‚Äù
