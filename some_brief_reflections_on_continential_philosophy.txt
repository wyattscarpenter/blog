Some Brief Reflections On Continential Philosophy (So-Called)

(I say "so-called" because this distinction is kind of fake; but it's also kind of real.)

I'm always thinking about this tweet:

  (Continental philosopher): Without 5, we could not count to 6.

  (Me): Yes.

  (Continental philosopher): It could be said 6 is consequently in the 5-shadow, the forthcoming of 6 is 5-heralded, that 5 springs necessarily from the recapitulation of 6.

  (Me, checking my watch): Yes.

General remark about the clarity of continental philosophy:

  Complaints continental philosophy is unclear usually ring hollow to me. Usually their passages are pretty clear; the problem is that they don't say anything interesting and true.

Brief remark about Heidegger in particular, who isn't even the worst of these but is often cited as being incomprehensible or meaningless:

  One of the weird parts about being able to understand Heidegger perfectly is that I can also tell when he starts just making stuff up.
