Recently, I read Moby-Dick. It's a great book, and you should read all of it. But, to address the elephant in the room: people complain that Moby-Dick has a lot of irrelevant digressions about whales and the whaling industry. This is, indeed, correct. Those digressions are just also good, and you should also read them. If, however, they aren't your cup of tea, you *can* just skip them and go to the whaling adventure story. This is pretty easy to figure out on your own; if Melville starts talking about some historical circumstance about whales, it's an expository chapter, and can be safely skipped. I think he did this as a service to readers like you! However, if you'd like help with this abridgment, I have prepared a table of guidance below. Chapters are marked either W for "Whale business", B for "Boat business", or L for "Land business". The "Land business" category is because about 15% of Moby-Dick takes place before they get on the Pequod, the main whaling ship they stay on for the rest of the novel (they even get on a different ship during this time!). However, you must read the "Land business" portions as well, because they contain crucial portions that enrich the work. I guess you can skip them if short on time. You may skip "Whale business", which is what I call the expository parts of the novel. Perhaps a poor name, because "Boat business" also includes the parts where the protagonists actively hunt whales. "Whale business" also includes bits where Ishmael is describing whale boats, except in cases where this is wholly embedded in a chapter describing an advancement in the plot.

(The structure of Moby Dick, fairly short chapters and many digressions, make some people assume it was written and published as a serial, as some serials from the time are similarly structured. But in fact it was written all at once and published as a book.)

The word-counts (approximate):
  Full book: 216,000
  Moby-Quick (the book sans W chapters): 158,000
So, perhaps it's not as "quick" as all that. In fact, this book is still longer than the average novel, which is about 100,000 words, maybe. But at least it's no-longer as long as TWO novels. Actually it's weird to me that it's so long, since I feel like its story is about average length, in terms of how many things happen. Well, whatever. I guess if you get rid of the Land busines as well, it becomes about 118,000 words (I just checked) — but, of course, this is not permissible.
