it seems somehow silly to do good when the laws of society are apparently designed to promote evil. maybe deal with those first.

by the way, that only works if you're right. in fact, i think one of the main evils promoted by my current society is related to spreading anti-capitalist propaganda (ironically, degrading life for other people). and so forth. (that's one of the less-important ones)
