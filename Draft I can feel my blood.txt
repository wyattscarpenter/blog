I don't think this even is cosmically interesting in any way or has some take-home message or something, but I can always feel my pulse. The idea that you would need to put your hand on your chest or neck to feel your pulse has always seemed funny to me (although that does make you feel the pulse of your heartbeat with your hand, i agree). First of all, when I cast my attention to it I can always feel my heartbeat in my chest cavity. I can also always, when i pay attention, feel the blood pulse through every part of my body, especially my hands and head, I've had both very good (I was a runner, and got my pulse down to 60 beats per minute, which was my goal so I could use it for timekeeping) and average cardiovascular health, so I doubt this is indicative of any problem. people also describe their heart pounding when they are stressed, but this isn't really it either; it happens when im active and also when im calm. in fact when I'm calm I can feel it the most, simply because I'm not distracted by anything else. (If I were stressed it's possible my heart would pound even harder and I would also notice that)

maybe the rest of you just need to pay attention better! try it. sit still and really introspect and see if you feel a pulsing. It should feel like every part of your body moves slightly about every second, in a way indicative of liquid flowing through it.

(I mean, gosh... I hope that's what that is! It would be very difficult for me to explain otherwise what the heck was going on with me.)

My heart also occasionally skips a beat, which is sort of like when your heart has an occasional hiccup. This is a disconcerting feeling, like when you miss a step in a staircase. But I looked it up and it's fine.

my heart as has a murmur. but many people do, and nothing looks weird on an EKG, apparently, so they let me leave
