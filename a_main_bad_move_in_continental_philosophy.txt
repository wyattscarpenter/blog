  Apropos of nothing, it occurred to me that one of the bad main moves in continental philosophy is basically synonym-pun-rhapsodize.
  For instance, to make something up: a power is a potential. Potentials exist in the future. Therefore (when you have the ability to walk) the becoming foreshadows the heralded in-of-it etc etc
  What struck me as interesting as how close this is to actual good thought.
  I've noticed a property of X. Here's something that property implies that you may not have thought about before. This demonstrates some conclusion that is interesting.
  Perhaps that's what makes the bad move so compelling. 
  It's like a pseudo deductive argument.
