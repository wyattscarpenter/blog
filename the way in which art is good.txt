Some people have a usefulness account of the reason for which art is good, which has always struck me as implausible. I use here the word art in a modern sense, encompassing plays, books, movies, music, and video games (Not in an old sense where it would mean craft or cunning); and also in a broad sense encompassing YouTube videos, songs you sing to yourself when you're alone, graphical patterns you appreciate, furniture, and newspaper comics (which is to say, I do not exclude any sort of aesthetic creation from the category of art on account of it not being, eg, sophisticated enough. This is simply how I'm going to use the word art in this post; I do not dispute that some of the things I call art are radically greater aesthetic values than others).

It's recently occurred to me that the correct resolution to the question of the purpose of art is not usefulness, nor really enjoyment, but in fact that creating and experiencing art is another category of good that is not dependent on the other two (although, of course, it can be traded off against the other two, by normal cunning
