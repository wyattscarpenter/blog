Previously: Life Should Feel Like Meth <https://wyattscarpenter.github.io/blog/life_should_feel_like_meth.txt>

A corollary of the idea that life should feel like meth is that â€”

you know how most of us spend a significant amount of time dealing with thinking about, and dealing with, shit we hate? You don't do that anymore. Your opportunity cost is way too high. You could be feeling like you were on meth and doing what you love, after all... & having those experiences legitimately, and not on meth, and for real!

(Incidentally, you know how everyone is always saying "life is too short to X"? Yeah, this is just that, when you get right down to it. But now life is even too shorter, because the opportunity cost is higher...)

This is even true for normal people, but it's even more true for you.
