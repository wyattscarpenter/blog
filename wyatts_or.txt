I invented Wyatt's Or in 2017 to aid in natural deduction proofs.

The symbol for Wyatt's Or is W, perhaps stylized Ｗ or ∨∨.

Wyatt's Or has the introduction rules of or (disjunction, ∧):

P
----
∴PWQ

Q
----
∴PWQ

And the elimination rules of and (conjunction, ∨):

PWQ       
---
∴P

PWQ       
---
∴Q

This tends to greatly simplify proofs.
