I invented Wyatt's Or in 2017 to aid in natural deduction proofs.

The symbol for Wyatt's Or is W, perhaps stylized Ｗ or VV.

Wyatt's Or has the introduction rule of an Or (disjunction):

 P
----W_I
∴PWQ

And the elimination rules of an And (conjunction)

 PWQ       
----W_E1
∴P

PWQ       
----W_E2
∴Q

This tends to greatly simplify proofs.
