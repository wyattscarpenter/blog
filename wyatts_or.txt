"Pierce and DeMorgan are pretty cool, they have basic logical laws named after them
Well, MOVE OVER"
--Wyatt S Carpenter

I invented Wyatt's Or in 2017 to aid in natural deduction proofs.

The symbol for Wyatt's Or is W, perhaps stylized Ｗ or ∨∨.

Wyatt's Or has the introduction rules of or (disjunction, ∧):

P
----
∴PWQ

Q
----
∴PWQ

And the elimination rules of and (conjunction, ∨):

PWQ
---
∴P

PWQ
---
∴Q

This tends to greatly simplify proofs.
