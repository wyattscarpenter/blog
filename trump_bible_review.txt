  Got my trump bible (inauguration day edition) a bit ago. It also includes a DVD "an all-star salute to Lee Greenwood", which I'm not going to watch but is a nice bonus I guess. The Bible itself is large print, authorized King James version, red letter edition. ISBN 979-8-218-31029-5. It is gold-edged. The fake leather of the cover and the graphic design thereof is nice. The type setting of the Bible itself is okay I guess. It's a Bible IDK what you want. I do sort of dislike how every verse is on its own line, and they indicate paragraph breaks using a pilcrow (¶) instead. I think it's far superior to simply have it be running text with the versification numbers in there as superscripts or something. The thin Bible page paper doesn't feel very good in this Bible, but I guess it's probably strengthened by adding some plastic or something. Unfortunately it's a little too translucent which is distracting when trying to read the text on a page and the text from the reverse side bleeds through a little. Some of the pages are initially stuck together at the top, which is weird. At the end of the Bible there is indeed an appendix on glossy paper that has the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, and the pledge of allegiance and also a section for notes I guess.

  All in all, I don't know how much Bibles cost — assuming you don't just get one for free from a neighborly Christian, which is quite likely — But assuming a regular Bible is like $30 or something $70 seems like a fine price to pay for the novelty of owning a Trump Bible as an individual. (Personally, I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine who really likes Trump and Bibles) (He also likes large print, so that's a pleasant surprise!)

Appendix A: many pictures? TODO
