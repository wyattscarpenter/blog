in this essay I will argue for the controversial claim that platonism is nominalism â€” Or, perhaps more accurately, that nominalism is a form of platonism

The core of my idea is that generally nominalism is a position that abstract objects and universals are just names that we give to things that things have in common. however, having listened to explanations of what platinism is actually supposed to be, I don't really think that's any different from what claytonism is. (Note to self correct these misspellings of platinism) actually, the abstract properties are just any way that anything could possibly ever be, and we assign names to some of them and not to others. 

I think the distinction between nominalism and platinism is due to other forms of platonism that claim something that's less intuitive, like that every abstract property has a physically instantiated paragon somewhere, like the perfect horse or something. That's not a great way of cashing out or defending any particular platonist view, but I'm not concerned with that here. 

to do justice to this, I'm going to have to read some SEP pages about platonism first
