for whatever reason, probably my idiosyncratic psychological makeup, a lot of my activities in life are trying to find delicious text and funnel it directly into my brain. 

  This has been kind of a rough couple decades for that. 

  back in the day, I imagine, you would just read newspapers and books and stuff, and talk to people, and that was pretty good. now, you maybe have a higher total volume of delicious text that you can put directly into your brain, but people are generally more unhinged now. Or at least they are in hinged in new and novel ways. people in the past probably were more prone to starting wars or something, as evidenced by the vast number of wars in the past, but people in the present have a new and more insidious way of being unhinged that I don't really care for.
    Alas! The wages of desiring delicious text is imbibing vast quantities of text, a small portion of which is genuinely regrettable â€” that you wish you could forget.
