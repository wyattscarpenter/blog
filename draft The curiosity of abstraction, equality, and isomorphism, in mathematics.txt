equality is how you say two things are the same in mathematics, and "isomorphic" is one way to say that two things in mathematics are the same if you abstract away some feature of them. But mathematical objects are already abstractions, so for a while The precise level of abstraction assumed was confusing to me, and thus this whole business was confusing to me. 

p.s. also that's all category theory is, sorry.
