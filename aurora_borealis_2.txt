I went outside and, much like last time, the night looks ever-so-slightly brighter and then if you take a picture it's more green than usual.

This is a sequel to https://wyattscarpenter.github.io/blog/unobserving_aurora_borealis.txt . Around 2024-10-09 we had a similar such event, where the northern lights crept down souther than usual.

Update 2024-10-10:
TODO: get previously written text, and perhaps pictures, in here, about the two subsequent days
