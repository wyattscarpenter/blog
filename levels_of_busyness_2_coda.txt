so, as I say, everyone of a certain level of interest in the world is always busy https://wyattscarpenter.github.io/blog/levels_of_busyness.txt

Whether you feel busy or not generally reflects your mood and/or whether you've grasped the nameless dao.

It might not be nameable, but I can still elaborate on it.

at any time, there is only so much you can do, and only so much you can achieve in a given amount of time. much like the stoic does not mourn the death of a man who was mortal, we should not mourn the limitedness of our time. only use our time, going forward, in the best or most enjoyable way possible. This is highly related to https://wyattscarpenter.github.io/blog/it_is_a_fear_of_using_reason.txt (about a fear of concluding what to do), and also probably various personality disorders I sometimes suspect I fall into (but that's just having an imperfect character, which we all do to some extent or another), and also just generally getting older and switching from explorer to exploit mode in your life. https://mindingourway.com/rest-in-motion/ is also a good blog post. It never really worked for me, but, you know. It's good.
