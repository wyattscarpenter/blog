The theater defies explanation. Every time I consider the theater I'm like "that's just a bunch of stuff happening for no reason. who would do this? for what purpose?"

but then I go to the theater and enjoy it.

(this makes it hard to say if it's actually valuable or a waste of time, given that I'm of two minds about it)
