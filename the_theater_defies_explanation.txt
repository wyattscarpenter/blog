Becoming European so I can say some shit like “the cinema is like a beautiful woman, you can understand her, and maybe you can love her, but she will never reveal her secrets” and have it get published in a small press book that costs like $70

The theater defies explanation. Every time I consider the theater I'm like "that's just a bunch of stuff happening for no reason. who would do this? for what purpose?"

but then I go to the theater and enjoy it.

(this makes it hard to say if it's actually valuable or a waste of time, given that I'm of two minds about it)
