I'm entering my Jibboo era.

Why do I say this? Well —

Observe the following picture, which is originally from Dr Seuss' _Oh, The Thinks You Can Think_, and which particular scan I took from https://tophatcomics.com/2019/09/04/the-haunting-world-of-dr-seuss-part-ii/ — and use here under fair use.

![[The Jibboo page from from Dr Seuss' _Oh, The Thinks You Can Think_. In a blue-tinted, nonsensical nighttime city, an ominous, apparently eyeless, bird creature offers salutations to a figure (the protagonist) in the distance. Text on the side asks: “And
what would
you do
if
you met
a ᴊɪʙʙᴏᴏ?”]](assets/im_entering_my_jibboo_era/jibboo.png)

I guess that hardly answer the question. Even though I posed and then answered the question myself. In particular, no one sees this picture of a jibboo and thinks it's anything but extremely ominous and threatening. Which seems like a bad era to enter.

And, the picture certainly has that vibe. But, on reflection, I've realized the jibboo has his hand up in a wave and is saying, "hey".

And so, for whatever, reason, this Jibboo resonates with me, and encapsulates how I'm feeling heading into 2025. Just like this picture of Daisy Ridley told me!

![[A meme based upon a picture of actress Daisy Jazz Isobel Ridley holding a blank sign and pointing at the viewer. The sign has been edited to say “Guess who's going to good year this 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025. All the numbers before 2025 have been crossed out, in various styles, and all the numbers seem to have been edited in, in various styles. I made this particular iteration of the meme (although there are many like it), and based it upon https://imgur.com/gallery/thank-you-moral-support-every-new-year-daisy-pzpVrHw ]](assets/im_entering_my_jibboo_era/daisy_jazz_isobel_ridley_2025_my_edit.jpg)

Maybe I like the Jibboo because he's clearly an experienced walker.
