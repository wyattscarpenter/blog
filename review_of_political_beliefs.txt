It's a good book.

I'm reading _Political Beliefs: A Philosophical Introduction_ by Oliver Traldi recently ([open access here](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/oa-mono/10.4324/9781003355274/political-beliefs-oliver-traldi)) and one of the things he's most impressed with during the book, which is also the most impressing thing he's discovered (from the academic field of "epistemic democracy"), is that due to the Condorcet Jury Theorem, independent thinkers add to the probability of a vote getting the right answer. But the group vote is then more likely to get the correct answer on any given question than a given individual. Which leads to the striking result that the pro-social move is to remain an independent thinker, as you improve the group outcome but get worse individual outcomes; and the antisocial move is to conform, as you get better individual outcomes but worsen the group outcomes.

Under ideal conditions, of course. But it has an unintuitive moral that applies to us when we approximate those conditions!

In a technical sense, "independent thinker" means that your errors aren't correlated with others'. And the main way your answers get correlated, in real life, is that you adopt somebody else's answers.

It's kind of crazy to me that the beginning of this book is a number of failed attempts to define politics, and he doesn't mention the polis even once!

like, all of his counterexamples fail because They aren't about the subject matter of politics, that is, "What should we do with the polis".

I think the Condorcet Jury Theorem result implies that you can make the voting process do better if you vote in a way that counteracts the correlation of others' votes. Which would be a real The Joker move.

In podcasts he's said it's hard to figure out what the people want from votes. Usually they don't even vote on issues! Just candidates. Such thinking has recently gotten me more excited about Liquid Democracy lately. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy for an example. I have a sort of muted view about it, but some of it seems cool and useful.

trolley hints at including the palace in his definition in around the 26-minute mark of This interview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7HLXsXoLzw so that may be reflected in his forthcoming paper on the matter

in his interview with quelette which hopefully I will remember to link here, Oliver trolley remarks that the end of his book is a little joke, but it's also true. I appreciate this joke now that it's been explained to me, and I think many people won't get it, so I will explain it so that you too can appreciate the joke if you read the book

My view on the actual book and subject matter and so forth.

As I say, it's a good book, and it covers many interesting topics. If you're interested in this subject matter, you may find it interesting! I'm not even that interested in the subject matter, and I also found it interesting. It is well written and often well argued, although it covers so much ground rapidly in order to be a good introduction (I suppose) But it often gives more of a sketch of positions than a knockdown conclusive argument about them or something. and like all philosophy fans, I yearn for those knockdown conclusive arguments about positions - - as rare as they may be. 

I hesitate to call this a weakness about the book, but I don't know what else to call it: One of the main things this book does is review epistemic literature about philosophical beliefs, and a lot of said literature is crazy theories some dumb Marxist came up with at some point. given the imprimature of respectability by the academy, where apparently people have just been able to say whatever for a long time without anyone checking up on them. I think the book approaches these respectfully but points out their weaknesses duly. i, however, have already independently become convinced of their falsity and shallowness, and therefore I didn't really learn anything in those chapters, although I still enjoyed reading traldi due to the other virtues of his writing listed above.

A similar situation happens with another good chunk of the book, which is based on extremely replication-crisis-y ideas that I also had independently figured out I should treat with extreme skepticism. having lived through the popularization of the replication crisis myself, and having been paying attention at that time as I was forging my epistemic tools to reason generally and about the efficacy of scientific studies in particular, I also did not learn much in these chapters. I say chapters but maybe they should be considered more like sections, nestled in chapters about the broader topics and giving due space to theories that have been popular at one point or another.

Not so similar, but related to my point about the polis above, I think my view on this entire subject is pretty deflationary. I guess I wouldn't have written this book! That's one way to say it. It seems like political beliefs are just theories about what we ought to do about some aspect concerning the polis; and people can be irrational about these, but not in a very different way that they can be irrational about any other thing. If you were living through the moments of culture that Oliver did, which I also lived through, and on Twitter, you might start thinking a lot about these ideas, because uhhh they would come up a lot. and you might think, good, I will now apply the tools of the Queen of reason, philosophy, to this topic. But I don't think you get out more than there is in there to begin with: the thing I just described, with a smattering of perhaps particular sociological forces on top which explain to you why the discourse would be so fractious. rancorous. 

It's also possible that there's some concept of the political that Oliver is entertaining that simply has no grasp on me, and that's why I think the questions and answers are simple and the definition obvious. in that case it's sort of an open question whether there's something to this extended concept of the political or whether it's just sort of a confused or mishmash concept. when Nancy pelosi says that passing some bill or another isn't political, I think that's just obviously false, or at least true merely in some sort of technical sense where political is taken as a metanim for there being a lot of political disagreement about the topic. I think a philosophical analysis of the concept with the standard tools of analytic philosophy is definitely sort of tilted in my favor, in that analytic philosophers, or at least the ones I've met, love a simple definition of XY that is X, about Y. so I might win unfairly in that hypothetical contest. A continental philosophy book where you're allowed to say that politics is the mother of necessity and the harbinger of being might allow you to say many more things about the extended concept of the political. This is a weird digression of just gone on. What was I trying to say?

aside: I like to describe phrases whose meaning are simply their component parts (combined in the normal way) as analytical phrases. "national park" is an example of an analytical phrase, at least in the US context, because it is a park that is owned by the nation (understood to mean the federal government, although each of the states in the union is technically a nation unto itself). "Athlete's foot" is a non-analytical phrase, because it refers to a particular disease, not any athlete's foot; It has a special meaning that cannot be deduced from its component parts. My inspiration here was the concept of analytical truth, where the truth is somehow contained within the component propositions, and also analytical languages, which combine their component parts very simply. perhaps in this new terminology I'm making up, a non-analytical phrase should be referred to as a synthetic phrase. This terminology has the potential to make things very confusing in limited contexts, but I enjoy using it, so I hope it catches on. This isn't related to this review at all, my talk of definitions simply reminded me of it. I suppose it is related, in the fact that I believe political beliefs is an analytical phrase (and, dare I say, an "analytical" concept).

back to the book I'm reviewing. Even though the concept seems simple to me, the book touches on many interesting aspects and theories of political activity. Even excluding the two categories of thing I discussed earlier, many of the theories about things which relate to political beliefs advanced by some of the people noted in the book seem obviously true or obviously false we're not worth talking about to me. But that's the way it always goes. philosophers are so hungry for people to take positions that they will even willfully misinterpret sometime some guy in ancient Greece said something that kind of sounds like being a global skeptic or something, and assign that to be a position so we can study it in our halls of philosophy. nothing wrong with that - - or if there is something wrong with it, it's beyond my pay grade to sort that out.

I probably will forget a lot of the things in this book, which is a shame because it probably contains some very enlightening content that will connect to a dispute I'm having years from now with someone who holds one of the (meta)beliefs examined in the book

I'm not really sure what to say about this, but a lot of the book deals with the moral foundations theory of Jonathan hate, sorry that my speech to text can't write that correctly, and I think basically treats it correctly with the attitude of it was an important and bold theory that was interesting and possibly salutary for its time, but has a lot of things about it that when you think about it seem like they are probably claiming much more than they have any right to claim. My opinion on this was already settled before reading the book, due to three events in my life: One hearing about the moral foundation theory independently earlier, when it was coming out in the news and the blogosphere and so forth. two noticing that during COVID the conservatives did not seem to be that worried about the literal foreign pathogen that the cleanliness foundation or whatever would predict they would take as an Uber serious threat (I mean, I think they took it as about as big of a threat as anyone else, on average, but then other contingent political factors meant that being more extreme ly worried about covid was kind of a democrat aligned thing for whatever reason; so obviously any predictive power of these moral foundations for actual real-world consequences is completely out the window, if it can't even get the simplest slam dunk implication to bear out in reality - - whatever the merits of it as a psychological explanatory tool are). Three reading this extremely long ACX YBR on the topic, which sort of comes to the same Demi skeptical conclusions (although I would have liked that to be more conclusive as well).

The moral foundations theory is a theory from a time that I think of as still being a time of relative innocence, for lack of a better word. is that thing that many have noticed and many have a theory for, although it's hard to say what the correct theory is... at some time in the past, after the 9/11 cultural moment that took a few years, I suppose, people were normal. perhaps even naive. A man like Jonathan hate could come along and say "progressives and conservatives support different policies because they have different opinions about what's valuable" and somehow this was treated as a novel consideration, which is something curious nowadays, and also did not immediately paint him as an enemy of mankind to the NPR listening masses. wokism was just Tumblr teens and a few kids on college campuses; many other political events had not yet unfurled; and the replication crisis was just a twinkle in John ionitis's eye.

I think this time still exists, if I would just go out of my way to find it. on a road trip, while discussing somewhat related matters, a friend of mine told me that the reason people get abortions is because of a lack of support or other options for women who get pregnant unwantedly. surely there can be no shortage of idealistic Americans in this great country of ours, with ideas that we should all get along. No matter how unrealistic about the mechanisms of society may ultimately be. perhaps I would simply have to give up my status of being a more lock and become one of the I forget what the other ones are called Elohim or something. and a fat lot of good understanding societal discourse has done me, anyway. No one has elected me president. or mayor. or state senator. or school board dog catcher. or politico. or apparatic. or even really asked my opinion. My interests in morality and acting and voting morally and effective altruism sort of entail that I should learn about how the world works and the nature of good and evil, but no one has really asked my opinions about those things, either. perhaps it's simply my incessant, and arguably quite healthy, drive to know.

Reading this book May not help me get to that place, if I even decided to live there. The metaphorical place of idealistic uninformed Americans. I like to believe that you can live as an idealistic informed American as well, by the way. Not that anyone asked me about that either. But it's sort of a conviction I acquired from philosophy - - or maybe that other philosophy enthusiasts simply also instinctually hold. or maybe reading this book will help. The end of this book sort of advises you against being political, which is probably good if you are an under-informed American who will assume the other political party is made of demons (instead of my supremely rational view, that political parties are made out of coalitions of demons and saints and huge masses of the under-informed), which may serve its readers well if indeed it is used as an introductory textbook in an introductory or perhaps elective philosophical or general interest college course. although it is sort of in conflict with much of the rest of the book. now that I've become a particularist about conspiracy theories, Oliver, (which I already basically was) how am I supposed to go about my life without knowing and evaluating the particularities of each conspiracy theory?! 

now that I've touched upon it, I should also talk about conspiracy theories, which I've always thought is a bad term. I prefer the term wing nut theory. conspiracy theory seems to me like it isn't an analytical phrase, at least how we use it now and probably since about 5 minutes after it was invented as a term; but it seems so temptingly like an analytical phrase that people always try to analyze it as such. But in many cases it's hard to say with the putative conspiracy being theorized about would be. I guess why everybody else denies the view? That's not very unique to wingnut theories, now is it! I should actually read the relevant chapter on the book and get back to this section that I'm writing now. are conspiracy theories themselves a conspiracy theory? how's that for a self-defeat argument.

so yeah, the book was good. I enjoyed it! looking forward to the next one.

I also enjoy listening to podcasts and interviews that Oliver Traldi does, and probably should move this sentence closer to the beginning of the review. I also enjoy reading a lot of the writing he's done. I think one of his strengths is making a valid argument, which is a rare virtue lol.

appendix A: typos I found in the work

there are typos in this work, this is not a critique of the work, all initially published large works tend to have typos, but I want to get these out of my notes so here they are:

> First, consider a case in which fifty people have opinions about what the income tax rate should be: the first person thinks it should be 1 percent, the second percent thinks it should be 2 percent, and so on.
"the second percent" should read "the second person".

> where . . . 0 indicated that the defendant should not be punished at all, and 8 indicated After
This quote does not include The end of the sentence which says what 8 indicated.

> On many of the same questions on which Americans displayed a risky shift, Taiwanese subjects showed a “cautious shift.” On most of the topics just listed, deliberation led citizens of Taiwan to become significantly less risk-inclined than they were before they started to talk.
There don't seem to be any topics just listed. This is in a quote, but perhaps an ellipsis should have been used, as it is time-to-time in other parts of the quote. Or perhaps that's unnecessary!

> I reproduced these examples at full length because I think they’re very fully striking and because Sunstein does a great job of explaining them himself.
Can you say something is very fully striking? maybe you can. or maybe it's a typo (perhaps fully was edited to very but the old word was left in as well)
