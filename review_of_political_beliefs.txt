It's a good book.

I'm reading _Political Beliefs: A Philosophical Introduction_ by Oliver Traldi recently ([open access here](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/oa-mono/10.4324/9781003355274/political-beliefs-oliver-traldi)) and one of the things he's most impressed with during the book, which is also the most impressing thing he's discovered (from the academic field of "epistemic democracy"), is that due to the Condorcet Jury Theorem, independent thinkers add to the probability of a vote getting the right answer. But the group vote is then more likely to get the correct answer on any given question than a given individual. Which leads to the striking result that the pro-social move is to remain an independent thinker, as you improve the group outcome but get worse individual outcomes; and the antisocial move is to conform, as you get better individual outcomes but worsen the group outcomes.

Under ideal conditions, of course. But it has an unintuitive moral that applies to us when we approximate those conditions!

In a technical sense, "independent thinker" means that your errors aren't correlated with others'. And the main way your answers get correlated, in real life, is that you adopt somebody else's answers.

It's kind of crazy to me that the beginning of this book is a number of failed attempts to define politics, and he doesn't mention the polis even once!

like, all of his counterexamples fail because They aren't about the subject matter of politics, that is, "What should we do with the polis".

I think the Condorcet Jury Theorem result implies that you can make the voting process do better if you vote in a way that counteracts the correlation of others' votes. Which would be a real The Joker move.

In podcasts he's said it's hard to figure out what the people want from votes. Usually they don't even vote on issues! Just candidates. Such thinking has recently gotten me more excited about Liquid Democracy lately. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy for an example. I have a sort of muted view about it, but some of it seems cool and useful.

trolley hints at including the palace in his definition in around the 26-minute mark of This interview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7HLXsXoLzw so that may be reflected in his forthcoming paper on the matter


appendix A: typos I found in the work

there are typos in this work, this is not a critique of the work, all initially published large works tend to have typos, but I want to get these out of my notes so here they are:

> First, consider a case in which fifty people have opinions about what the income tax rate should be: the first person thinks it should be 1 percent, the second percent thinks it should be 2 percent, and so on.
"the second percent" should read "the second person".

> where . . . 0 indicated that the defendant should not be punished at all, and 8 indicated After
This quote does not include The end of the sentence which says what 8 indicated.

> On many of the same questions on which Americans displayed a risky shift, Taiwanese subjects showed a “cautious shift.” On most of the topics just listed, deliberation led citizens of Taiwan to become significantly less risk-inclined than they were before they started to talk.
There don't seem to be any topics just listed. (are we still in the quote? My reader may not have displayed the format correctly)
