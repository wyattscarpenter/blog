this is mainly just a one-paragraph musing on how to orient yourself if you're not afraid of money, which paragraph will occur after this one. but here is some emotional I can provide that might make the following paragraph make a little bit more sense if you're not already on the same wavelength and in the same mindspace as me: For a while, I have felt as though things were accelerating. The problems to which I think myself able to approach are increasing in magnitude. maybe this is good, or bad; but mostly I think it's inevitable. I was already aware of the problems and wanted to solve them; I was just afraid of them. (Still am!) I was never not going to try to solve every problem in the world (as I have put it previously). As some wit somewhere once wrote: “I'm just going through the motions. But the dance is complicated, and the music is beginning to speed up.” One of the things about thinking yourself equal to great and ponderous tasks is that the little tasks seem to seem small and useless. On some level they're inherently valuable, but maybe it's not my comparative advantage to engage in them. After all, I've deliberately given myself a very valuable set of skills. why learn French when I can hire a translator with some scratch from my day job that I learned how to do instead of learning French? 

The more capitalismpilled you are, the more you have to acknowledge that your values are commensurate with, and thus not subservient to, the dollar.  You can be an au pair or go to university. You simply have to be aware that you are giving up some earning potential to enjoy a life experience. In a sense, that you're buying it.
