Is there a hypernym for hypernyms and hyponyms? This blog file name has created "hypoernym" on accident, which has some merit. Well, whatever. That doesn't matter.

I'm trying to get a bunch of reading-related words started. Do audiobooks count as reading? Who cares? however, my submission is that they should be considered "lireading" (pronounced lih-reading or luh-reading, like the first part of "listening"). now everybody wins! people can keep their weird complex that they acquired from the education system about decoding letters with their eyes, and I can accurately tell you how I consumed a book. Reading a comic will be called creading (hard c). consuming media in general — consuming is a rather crass term, isn't it? My friend Gio thinks so, and prompted for a new one. I believe the general term for this, which I've just made up on the spot, shall be "zhune", pronounced like zhuzh plus zune (sort of). /ʒun/. rhymes with June. In fact it sounds a lot like the French word for June (to an american, at least). "reading" will get to the the specific term for reading with your eyes; the more general term, encompassing both lireading and reading, will be zreading. (This is pronounced like it's spelled. The Z is not pronounced like "zee", pronounced like a Z sound said before the R sound. there is no vowel between them. try it! It's easier than you might think! (You may find it easier to think of there being an i between the z and the r, which you don't pronounce —— although, this might mislead you)). skimming/skim-reading remains a perfectly cromulent term that we shall continue to use as appropriate, and continue to adorn with adjectives like "fast skim" and "somewhat-thorough skim", which shall most-probably be sufficient.

It is also permissible to pronounce lireading without a vowel sound between the l and the r (advanced technique).
