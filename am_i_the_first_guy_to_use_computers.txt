Am I the first guy to ever use computers? Signs point to yes.

Granted, it is really weird that there are so many computers around without other people using them, and I'm pretty sure I've read books, like history books and stuff, in which other people use computers. However, the evidence is compelling.

There have been so many times where I try to do something extremely basic, something that would be the first idea you would have the first day you used computers, and then I discover that the thing I'm trying to do is either impossible or requires an extremely-roundabout, hacky method to accomplish.

No one would have invented computers, and then used them, and failed to address these issues.

Therefore, I conclude, against all odds, that I am the first person in the world to use a computer.
