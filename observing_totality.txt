Totality review: the sun isn't supposed to do that lol

Today, 2024 April 8th, I observed a total eclipse in Beachwood, Ohio.

It's kind of hard for my phone to take pictures of it, so just imagine a disc being obscured by another disc.

The moon obscures the sun just so, so that the sun is covered but its corona is visible around the moon, like an aura.

I don't find the actual fine-tuning argument very convincing, because I have no idea what the distribution of universal constants are " supposed to be like ". However, the fact that the Earth happens to be in an arrangement with its moon and sun in such a way that it creates an incredible astronomical event that you don't get on other planets, and which if you read in a sci-fi book you would think "that's technically possible but it would be really unlikely", makes some kind of an argument for man's significance in the universe.

I believe in god now, but like the paleolithic sun deity

I believe in the platonic God now, the one that is just a sphere. I mean, I just saw it!
