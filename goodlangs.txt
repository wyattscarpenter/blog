I have an interest in programming languages, which extends to esoteric programming languages. I have invented or implemented several of these which I link to here with brief explanations.

10 Aug 2018 wu: simply the best programming language https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/wu

11 Sep 2018 ya: simply the most accurate statistical package. "found these source files / on an old floppy disk my russian grandmother gave me. how strange." https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/ya

15 Sep 2018 fhq9+-: an expanded version of HQ9+- called FHQ9+-, in a single html file. Prior to 2018 this code was an implementation of an expanded version of HQ9+ called FHQ9+ https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/fhq9

19 Jan 2020 fractran: stunned by how simple yet Turing complete FRACTRAN was, I decided to write an implementation in C to wrap my head around it https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/fractran

I am unlikely to do any more of these. I feel like I have exhausted the interest they held for me.
