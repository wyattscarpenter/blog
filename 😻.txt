It has come to my attention that my cat loves me. I have become convinced of it. This has a number of implications.

firstly it means cats have inner experience

I think it's funny that my cat clearly loves and values me very much, but seems to lack a theory of mind about how I eg look in a particular direction in the same way that he does as an animal. I think this actually disproves some esoteric philosophical views about what it means to care for someone, probably.
