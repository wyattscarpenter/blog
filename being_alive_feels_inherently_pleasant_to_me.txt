This is a remark I thought about during writing another post, but so it doesn't get lost or make too big of a tangent there: being alive feels inherently pleasant to me.

There's often a lot of stuff on top of living that makes it feel unpleasant. like these brutal headaches I get all the time. or tragedy striking. etc. but if you can ignore that, and pay attention simply to the way literally being alive feels, that feeling is constantly, mildly good. it's nice.

This is one reason why I will never kill myself.
