From what I remember of a philosophy of aesthetics course I once listened to online (a MOOC), Kant thought that beauty was related to — or maybe the best type of beauty was — something he called Transcendence, which was apparently very usefully evoked by looking at the Great pyramids, as their massive scale yet intricate detail can overwhelm you, and fill your whole vision, and allow you to contemplate the nature of infinity. 

our lives are like that 

possibly by definition. (or, that is to say, by the vry nature of the constraints of being a being.) they are as vast as we'll ever be, we are but a small part of them. they are full of details.

and as beautiful as that is, it's very inconvenient. I'm trying to live a good life out here. It is a task that I wish to approach, not simply marvel at. and yet I am dumb struck - - made a fool.
