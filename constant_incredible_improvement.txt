Sometimes I forget that I'm in the "larval stage of my greatness", that I will continue to improve infinitely, and, God willing, I will live a long life. A life so much longer than my entire life up to this point, even. It's just going to get better and better, because I will make it do so. Years and years and it's just going to keep improving and improving...

Thought ahead to being 50, and how many things I will have done and secured by then, and how great my life will have been and how much life I will have after that as well... it is so good...!

This thought brought to you by the fact that I have energy, and am doing tasks I need to complete in my life before I get on with other things, but realized they all add to the continuing greatness that is my life.
