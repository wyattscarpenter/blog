My Work As A Game Of Chess

I go into work, right. And then I just start crying.

I'm fully kidding! I just thought that would be a funny thing to say. (In fact it's sort of a quote of a funny thing someone said online once but I can't find the source of that so whatever.) In fact, I love my job.

recently, ive been thinking of my work like a game of chess.
