I think we should have a special symbol for the word "by" in the sense of authorship. Many special symbols help with pronunciation or brevity or something like that, but this one would just help pick out that meaning, and render it unambiguous. (Don't even get me started on the phrase "named after"...!) I think the symbol should be like the "care of" symbol, ℅, except with the letters b and y. Much like how ℅ can be written c/o, the by symbol can be written b/y. Until we get our own sick unicode codepoint for it. Also, the by symbol should be in a little box. Not like an emoji or anything, just that the symbol should be in a square outline. So, you could approximate that as [b/y], if you wanted.

I will now stop posting about typography I should like to have (at least for the moment), lest my blog slowly become a collection of typographical edicts — and I already have a collection of typographical edicts that works fine! https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/typographical-edicts
